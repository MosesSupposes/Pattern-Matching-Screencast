# Pattern Matching

**Pattern matching** is a condensed form of conditional control flow (think if/else statements) that gives you more flexibility and semantic control when evaluating data.

And it does this exhaustively; meaning it coerces you — or at least encourages you, depending on the compiler — to handle all possible edge cases.

[Here's a description](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/pattern-matching-destructuring) from the Rescript documentation

```
One of ReScript's best feature is our pattern matching. Pattern matching combines 3 brilliant features into one:

- Destructuring.

- "switch" based on shape of data.

- Exhaustiveness check.
```
